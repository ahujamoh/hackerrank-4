Write a code in whichever language you are comfortable with to print as many prime numbers as you can. The prime numbers can be separated by a space or a newline. Your score is the number of prime numbers you print. Can you be in the top 50 percentile? - a surprise waits.. You can read about different prime number algorithms here

//  40000 elapsed: 0.960590 by checking using int instead of long
//  40000 elapsed: 0.194436, by studying upper bounds of max prime factor (was 691 for 40,000)
//  TODO: use log/exp/proportions to give a lower number for 40,000 , higher number for 1000
