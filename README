Primes

Write a code in whichever language you are comfortable with to print as many prime numbers as you can. The prime numbers can be separated by a space or a newline. Your score is the number of prime numbers you print. Can you be in the top 50 percentile? - a surprise waits.. You can read about different prime number algorithms here

//  40000 elapsed: 7.828817 by via checking only first half factors

//  40000 elapsed: 0.960590 by checking using int instead of long
//  40000 elapsed: 0.194436, by studying upper bounds of max prime factor (was 691 for 40,000)
//  TODO: use log/exp/proportions to give a lower number for 40,000 , higher number for 1000

/**
 * How many primes are you trying to find. useful to target which spot you want 
 * to get on the leaderboard. Made it to #5 with the last commit
 *
 * For benchmarking flip to 40,000
 * For testing, flip to http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/1000.txt and compare last
 * For making it to #5 on the leaderboard on http://hackerrank.com, flipped to 195100 :)

See main.c for actual code. written on a mac, on a weekend dedicated to C/C++.

Found this puzzle on http://hackerrank.com ( this solution hit #5 in the leaderboard finding 195101 primes )
